A Paper?
--------

1) Explore alternative scenarios that could potentially explain individual Bd profiles
	-- Temperature dependent growth rate
	-- Temperature and time dependent immune response
	-- Temperature-seeking behavioral regulation
    A) Describe alternative sensible functional forms
    B) Simulate Bd profiles over an array of parameters, compare to real data, look for likely parameter spaces

 ^^ Determine if the variation in the underlying parameters needed to explain the variation in the real profiles is realistic among-individual variation or if this variation points to something else that is likely going on (transmission dynamics)  


2) Simulate population-level Bd profiles using the functional forms from the above work
    A) Determine fit to these data | alternative assumptions for how transmission is occurring


3) Identify the functional forms/parameters that
    A) lead to equivalent fits (alternative likely scenarios to resolve)
    B) change the answer a lot (a sensitivity to validate)


Issues
------

1) So many possible parameter combinations
2) Newt Bd profiles are very noisy
3) Newts are sampled over a relatively narrow temperature band
